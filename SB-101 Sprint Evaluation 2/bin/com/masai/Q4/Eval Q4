A)
What is normalization and why is it needed?

Normalization is the process in which we reduce the amount of 
redundant data and store the meaningful data in RDBMS it is basically organizing 
the data in smaller smaller table with specific relations


Need of Normalization:
 to avoid or eliminate the duplicate data in different tables
 i.e. to avoiding the storage of the same data in the different tables
 or more than one table;
 to make sure that data store in the tables are related and gives the meaning ful '
 output  
 
 B)
 What is the 2NF? Explain with an example. You don’t need to draw the
tables or write the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the
third normal form.

2NF id the relation between the 1NF that in 2NF the non-prime attribute
 are depend on the key and form the normalized form i.e. every non-key column in table 
 depends on the value of the key

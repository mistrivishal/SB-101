What is TRANSACTION :-

In the DBMS transaction is the set of or group of the logical 
operations to perform the specific task or action 
In transaction A group of transaction is said to complete when 
we commit the code else we can rollover the action we did in the 
logical part before commiting;

What is ACID properties:-

Basically ACID is the short form of the four key properties of the transaction,
i.e.
1. Atomicity,
2. Consistency,
3. Isolation,
   &
4. Durability.

1. Atomicity:- It is the property of transaction which perforemed on the exchange of data,
			   eg. whenever we want to transfer the fund from one account to another the
			   whole cycle needs to be completed like debit and credit should be completed;
			   
2. Consistency:- Consistency is the property that keep data consistent through out the 
				 transaction process which means data debited from one account is the same 
				 data credited to another one should be equal;
				 
3. Isolation:- While the process of the transaction the data is ISolated and invisible to 
 			   other transaction process and keep data safe;
 			   
4. Durability:-  Is basically successful exchange of the data an not left undone the process
                IT ENSURES THE COMPLETION OF PROCESS IN NOT MATTER WAHT HAPPENS AND PROCESS WILL NOT BE REVERSED

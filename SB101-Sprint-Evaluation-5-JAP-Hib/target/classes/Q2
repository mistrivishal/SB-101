● Explain @Cascade and @mappedBy annotations:-
----------------------------------------------

	@Cascade:- In JPA-Hibernate we use @Entity for persisting the objects in to the database but when we need to
			   we need to persist the Child Entity along with the Parent Entity having relation between them like,
			   One-To-One, One-To-Many, and Many-To-Many then we have to use some annotation like @cascade
			   Cascade is type of the Enum which haves the operations like "PERSIST", "MERGE", "DETACH" and "ALL".
			   
			   Basically above all the Enumns use in perform the PERSISTING operation when we establish the dependencies
			   between the Parent entity and child entity by Persisting only Parent Entity in transaction area the child
			   entity also got persisted
			   
			   
	@mappedBy:- When we use the bidirectional mapping like one-to-many or many-to-many there is dependencies between to tables 
			    get establish by use of the Primary key and Foreign key by which we get one extra table which has the relation
			    between two tables foreign keys but when we already establish the connection between them why we need extra tables
			    so we use the @mappedBy annotation in Entity for other side Entity instance by which we know who owns the 
			    relationship reference.
			    
			    
● What is ORM in Hibernate?

	ORM is basically "Object relational Mapping", Hibernate is itself ORM tool which use the JPA 
	internally to map the classes to the database tables by using SQL queries. We can handle the 
	traditional mismatch in the database tables by using the ORM.

What is lazy loading and eager loading in hibernate?


Answer:-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	In hibernate we have to types object they are "First Level" and "Second Level" objects,
	When we map the objects to the database we use the hibernate Entity class and the we 
	persist it, Bu when we try to fetch the objects then by default the Hibernate do the lazy
	loading it means when we try to access the first level object we get all the instance 
	and methods of the first level object but at the time of accessing the "Second Level" 
	object we not get the instance and methods of the Second level object that situation of
	not loading the second level object is called as Lazy loading...
	
	To avoid the this situation we use some annotation in the parent class for the second level 
	object instance:-
	
	we use the Eager loading annotation @ElementCollection(fetch=FetchType.EAGER)

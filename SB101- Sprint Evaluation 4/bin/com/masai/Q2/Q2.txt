1 Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate:
2 Explain Layered Architecture:


1. -> 						JPA											Hibernate
			1. JPA is the specification for the JAVA		1. Hibernate is a framework for mapping 
			   applications manage with database			   the java objects with database;
			2. It is the standard API helps to perform  	2. it implements the SQL and the java object
			   database operations								mapping with database

2. ->
			Layered Architecture is the set of the layers which are dependable on each other,
			when developer develops the application it has the following three layers in general:--
			1.Data Layer
			2.Application Layer
			3.Presentation layer:
			
			
			1. Data Layer:- Data layer is basically the data handling layer by which the application communicate
						   with database and get the data required and has no dependencies further, which transfer the data 
						   to application layer   
						   
			2. Application Layer:- Application Layer where we put all the implementation logic and code by which we can validate 
								  the data coming from the presentation layer and passing to the data layer it means the 
								  Application Layer is depend upon the Data layer for the validation;
			
			3. Presentation layer:- Presentation layer is the layer by which our application connect with users and where we handle the
									incoming data from the user and give the response to the user, And the Presentation layer depends 
									upon the application layer to do the all functionalities and give the response to user

What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

1. In Hibernate no need of any SQL queries a hibernate is an all the methods are inbuilt to create the SQL commands
	whereas the JDBC required the knowledge about SQL queries and complex coding;

2. No need to create table at every new changes in the column as the hibernate is set of an object and object is 
	treated as the table in hibarnate where as in JDBC we have to create the table by our own and if any alteration 
	should be updated as well in JDBC. 

3. In hibernate the data is in synchronise and if we make any changes from the implementation it will be reflected in the data bases..
	in JDBC we have to change implementation and updated that into DB as well;
	
4. The mapping of the Java objects with the Database tables are taken care in JDBC but whereas the in Hibernate no need to map the 
   tables or JAva objects during the process Hibernate provides the object persistence.
 
5. Hibernate use the API and protocols to accessing the data from the data base and avoids the complex coding..
